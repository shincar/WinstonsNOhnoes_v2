# Winston & Ohnoes v2

Integrate chat feature from examples of socket.io. Later I will try to add feature for pairing someone on internet to play this game.

## How to use

```
$ cd WinstonsNOhnoes_v2
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

And point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. Optionally, specify
a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.

## Features

- Multiple users can join a chat room by each entering a unique username
on website load.
- Users can type chat messages to the chat room.
- A notification is sent to all users when a user joins or leaves
the chatroom.
